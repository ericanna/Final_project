# Final project for the Data Analytics' Ironhack Bootcamp.

# Reading Women

## Goal of the project
Create a book recommendation system that recommends exclusively books written by female authors.
As an MVP, we aim to make a recommendation system based on user choices such as literary genre, region of birth of the author and year of the first publication.
If there's still time, we aim to add to the scope of the project the possibility that the user inputs the title and author of a book he already likes (either female or male author) and the system recomemends another similar book written by a female author.

## Dataset
For the MVP, we'll use the *Good Reads Author Gender Analysis*, available in Kaggle.
For the second feature, we'll use, in addition to this dataset, the Goodread's API.
