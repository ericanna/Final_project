# Reading Women
Final project for the Data Analytics' Ironhack Bootcamp.


## Scope of the project
A book recommendation system that recommends exclusively books written by female authors.

## Dataset
I'll use the *Good Reads Author Gender Analysis* dataset, available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brosen255/goodreads-books). This dataset was based on information gathered in the [Goodreads plataform](https://www.goodreads.com). I filtered only the female authors out of the original dataset and ended up with 10690 rows. In the data cleaning step I aim to remove authors whose average rating (information provided by one of the columns) is less than 3.5, in order to mantain a good level of quality in the works recommended.
