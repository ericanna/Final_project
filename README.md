# Final project for the Data Analytics' Ironhack Bootcamp.

# Reading Women

## Goal of the project
Create a book recommendation system that recommends exclusively books written by female authors.

As an MVP, I aim to make a recommendation system based on user's choices such as literary genre, region of birth of the author and year of the first publication.

If there's still time, I aim to add to the scope of the project the possibility that the user inputs the title and author of a book he already likes (either female or male author) and the system recomemends another similar book written by a female author.

## Dataset
For the MVP, I'll use the *Good Reads Author Gender Analysis* dataset, available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jotamaggi/good-reads-author-gender-analysis/data). This dataset was based on information gathered in the [Goodreads plataform](https://www.goodreads.com). I filtered only the female authors out of the original dataset and ended up with 10690 rows. In the data cleaning step I aim to remove authors whose average rating (information provided by one of the columns) is less than 3.5, in order to mantain a good level of quality in the works recommended.
For the second feature, I'll need to use, in addition to this dataset, the Goodread's API.
